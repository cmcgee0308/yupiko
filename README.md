# yupiko
This project is inspired by the game Bingo. It is a simplified version as it does not have a fancy UI. Its purpose is to create a functioning game using Python to encourage new contributors. Two players will be given a random 5x5 card that contain numbers ranging from 1 to 25. Each player will take turns guessing a number on the opponent's card. The game will end when 5 in a row, column, or diagonal is fully crossed.
